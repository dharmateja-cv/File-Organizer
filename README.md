# File Organiser

This Python Script automatically organises files in specified path
in one go.

## What you can do with it?

- Add a shortcut in your terminal for automatically organising files
- Schedule the script to execute at a particular time every day
- Keep your files organised..? :P

## How it Works?

2. Scans the files in that path
3. Checks each file's extension and moves them in their respective folder accordingly

## Usage

```python
python organise.py <dir_path>
```

## Examples

```python
python organise.py ~/Downloads
```

## Requirements
